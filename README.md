# Ulauncher-PulseControl

_Ulauncher plugin to control pulseaudio_

This plugin is meant to be used to quickly change audio device and set the current volume.

## Usage

You need to use pulseaudio for this plugin to work.

### Volume

Per default, use 'volume' to change your volume. You have different pre-describing options, but you may also just type a percentage (without trailing percentage character) after 'volume' to set the volume to any given percentage. Anyway, all audio devices will be changed to the new volume.

### Device

Per default, use 'device' to get a selection of your current audio devices. If you choose on, all current audio streams will be moved to this device and the device will be set default for all future streams.

## Suggestions

If you have any suggestions (or if you encounter any errors), feel free to create an issue.
The plugin was build on one day and without the intention to e.g. support multiple audio streams on different sinks. Anyway, I think it's easily is possible, so if you want it, feel free to create an issue for it aswell.
